# This USB-serial converter is embedded on current Intel development
# boards.  Note the converter chip is on the USB gadget / Type-B / test
# device side, whereas this cp210x.ko driver runs on the USB host /
# Type-A / "workstation" side. So why include this driver on test
# devices = on the "wrong" side?  Because it's much easier to connect
# two test devices which are already next to each other rather trying to
# sneak a new USB host on a crowded lab shelf or trying to use a laptop
# help up in the air. Also, these are modules so not loaded unless
# actually in use.
